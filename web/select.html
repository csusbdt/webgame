  The select screen shows current progress in the game and let's the
  user select how the game is to be resumed.

  <ul>
  <li><a href="maps/test.html">test map</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Note:</h2>
  
  <p>
  The test map shows how a map can be defined directly in HTML. 
  Under this organization scheme, each map is defined
  directly in its own HTML file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The test map also illustrates how movement in a table-based grid can be accomplished,
  and it shows a possible way to initiate interactions with NPCs and
  other triggers built into the grid.
